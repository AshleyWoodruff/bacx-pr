# Topic types

There are several content types, each of which uses a unique way to provide information to the user. Each topic type has been designed to deliver information in the most effective way. Because Dynamics 365 content is written for a variety of audiences, this topic shows the different content types that we use for each audience. 

- [Home page](#Home_page)
- [Overview](#Overview)
- [Get started](#Get_started)
- [What’s new](#What's_new)
- [Procedure](#Procedure)
- [Accessibility](#Accessibility)
- [FAQ](#FAQ)
- [Glossary](#Glossary)

## <a name="Home_page">Home page</a>

These are also known as *landing pages*. A home page does not just mirror the TOC nor should it be a link farm, but instead is should provide some overview information and possibly graphics that are helpful to the reader. 

### Title
- Use “home page”, lowercase and two words, at the end of the topic title. 
- Do not use “landing page” or “welcome”. 

### Example
[System administration home page](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/sysadmin/system-administration-home-page)


## <a name="Overview">Overview</a>

An overview topic describes what the user can do with this feature using plain terms and no jargon. Think about why the user would use this feature or product and write your topic to address this. 

An overview topic can contain but is not limited to this kind of content:

- Overview information
- Problems and solutions
- Definitions and descriptions
- Business process or architectural information
- Examples

All or a combination of those elements can be used to describe:

- What the user can do with a feature or product using plain terms and no jargon. 
- Key concepts that a user must understand to complete a task successfully.
- The situations that the topic material might apply to.
- Business process or architectural information. 
- Instructions about where and how user’s need to make decisions.

### Title
- Use a noun phrase for the title. 
- In general, use singular nouns. However, it’s okay to use a plural noun when the plural is obviously more suitable.
- Be careful about using “overview” in the title. Most noun phrases can stand on their own without “overview.”
- Do not use these terms in the title: Summary, User guide, Welcome

### Example
[Dual-write overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/dual-write-overview)


## <a name="Get_started">Get started</a>


## <a name="What's_new">What's new</a>

This topic provides resources where you can learn about the new features that have recently released or new features that will be releasing over the next few months. These topics should not contain any feature descriptions. For feature descriptions, provide a link to the feature description in the release plans. Do not include any feature information that has been postponed.

If needed, you can break this information into subsections.

Some teams include a section for “In development”. This is where you can provide a high-level overview of features expected in the next release.

### Title
- Write as either “What’s new in <Product name> <version>” or “What’s new or changed in <Product name> <version”, depending on the content in the topic. Including <version> is optional. 
-	Do not use “New features” in the title.  
 
### Example
[What's new or changed in Finance and Operations apps home page](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/whats-new-changed?toc=/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/toc.yml)


## <a name="Procedure">Procedure</a>


## <a name="Accessibility">Accessibility</a>


## <a name="FAQ">FAQ</a>

Write an FAQ to introduce concepts that the user needs to understand. Include only the concepts that are related to work that the user is trying to do. Write questions that are likely to be asked. You can include any combination of Who, What, Why, Where, When, and How questions that you need. You don't have to include all of these types. Provide answers to all of the questions. 

Be careful not to use an FAQ as a catchall topic. In most cases, this kind of content can fit into existing content to fill in gaps or troubleshooting issues. If an FAQ topic is needed, most likely the content will be based on customer/partner questions that cannot be answered by adding content to existing topics. 

Each heading should be the written in the form of a question. The subsequent section will include the answer. 

#### Writing questions 
- Make sure that you understand who the audience is for your topic. Identify the types of questions that this user would ask. 
- Phrase the questions as if the reader is asking them. Say what can I, instead of what can you. 
- Be sure that the questions are likely to be asked. Don’t make up a question to fit existing content. Instead, identify the questions and then revise the existing content to answer questions that users would ask. 
- Focus on writing questions that are related to customer tasks or scenarios, not on describing the UI. 
- Organize the questions in a logical order. For example, consider the following options: 
  - Most general to most detailed 
  - Most common to least common 
  - Least technical to most technical 
- If your topic has more than 10 questions, consider whether the topic can be subdivided. If the topic has only 3-4 questions, consider whether it can be combined with an existing non-FAQ topic. 

#### Answering questions
Include at least one sentence for the answer and if needed, include tables, lists, links, graphics, or any other type of content that is needed to answer the question. 
If you include a yes/no question, start the answer with Yes or No. Then add explanatory information. 

### Title
- Use a noun phrase for the title. 
- Always include “FAQ” at the end of the title. Do not spell out “frequently asked questions”. 
- The title should not include "Q and A" or “Q&A”.

### Example
LinkedIn integration FAQ


## <a name="Glossary">Glossary</a>

A glossary provides an alphabetical list of definitions for words, phrases, and acronyms that are used for a product or product area. 

In general, a glossary term is:

- A key concept that is highly relevant to the product and helps users understand the product.
- Not part of the common English language, as defined by a standard dictionary such as The American Heritage Dictionary.
- Frequently used within the documentation.

The following best practices ensure that terms and definitions are consistent in a glossary. 

- Use the singular form of the term. 
- Use lowercase for the term, unless it is a proper noun. Check the style guide to see if the term is listed and follow the capitalization. 
- Enter acronyms, abbreviations, and initialisms in their full form, and include the abbreviated form in the definition. 
- Don’t restate the term as the definition. For example, don’t define tax hierarchy as A hierarchy of taxes. 
- Don’t copy definitions word-for-word from existing, non-Microsoft sources. 
- Be sure that other key concepts in the definition have also been defined. 

### Title
- Use either the standalone term “Glossary” or precede “glossary” with a product name, such as “Commerce glossary”. 

### Example
[Customer Insights glossary]
