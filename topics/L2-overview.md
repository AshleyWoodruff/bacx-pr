## Purpose
The **L2 overview** gives a top-level description of each subgroup within a main product (for example, **Power Apps** is the product and **Sophisticated apps on a unified platform** is the L2). 

## Guidelines
This overview should speak to the value of the features as a group, how they benefit the customer, and how they work together.
