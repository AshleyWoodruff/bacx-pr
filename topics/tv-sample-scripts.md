Here are some examples of scripts used for other technical, how-to demo videos that were created for Dynamics 365 or Power Platform. 
(More sample scripts are coming soon.)

**Script sample 1**
Hi, I’m (your name). I’m a program manager for Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations and I’m going to show you the new, re-imagined expense experience on the Expense Management workspace.
Users who create or administer games in Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Gamification must be KPI Managers in Dynamics 365 to effectively start and manage games. 
This security role grants a user access and permissions on the Gamification solution.  
KPI Managers can only edit KPIs they own, either those they create themselves or those they were assigned ownership by a System Administrator. 
To assign this security role to a user in Dynamics 365, go to Settings from the ribbon. Next, select Security, then select Users on the next page. 
Open the record for the user who will be a KPI Manager by selecting the name. On the next page, select Manage Roles.  
In the new window, select the checkbox beside KPI Manager and then Save.
