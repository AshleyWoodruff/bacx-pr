# Metadata

| Audience | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| TBD | TBD |

## Purpose
The metadata is "hidden" content that helps users find topics through search engines. Search engines use the content in the metadata field to generate relevant results to users. Below is an example of what users see in their searches:

## Guidelines
Use the following guidelines when writing metadata:

* Describe the feature in a brief but impactful way.
* Use full sentences, not just a list of keywords.
* Include important words that aren't in the description or title. What would your audience type into a search engine to look for this feature?
* Imagine what this will look like in a search result. Notice how the content is cut off in the image above.
* **Do not** just repeat the feature name.
