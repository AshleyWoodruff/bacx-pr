# Release plans guide

This guide provides information on how PMs, writers, content strategists, editors, and other team members can contribute to our official release plans content on [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/business-applications-release-notes/).

Use this guide for specifics about the release plans, including [differences](rn-dos-donts.md) from the Contributors Guide. 

With the **2019 release wave 2 plans**, we implemented the following changes:
- Changed the name to "release plans" from "release notes."

- Moved to new repos in GitHub.

- Split the content into two parts: Dynamics 365 and Power Platform. This includes publishing two separate PDFs.  

- Introduced the Release Planner tool. PMs use this to input their feature information for the release plans. The information is pushed into GitHub and used for the BAG product roadmap. 

For information about using the Release Planner tool for **wave 2 and later** release plans, see the [BAG Release Planner App Guide](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/ProjectBahnhof/EYBGZgE9Js5CioBE2LAIjSwBCgn_hvM9QtZ7gPimS85vkQ?rtime=wfKEAl4m10g).

For information about using GitHub to edit content with our team, refer to the main [Contributors Guide](contributors-guide.md).
