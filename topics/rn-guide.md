# Release plans guide

This guide provides information about how PMs, Writers, Content Strategists, and other members from the feature team can contribute to our official release plans Notes content on [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/business-applications-release-notes/). 
For all basic information about using GitHub to create content with our team, refer to the main [Contributors Guide](contributors-guide.md). Use this guide for specifics about the release plans project, including [differences](rn-dos-donts.md) from the Contributors Guide. 

- **[2019 wave 2 release plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2019wave2/)** With this deliverable, we:
  - Switched to calling them "release plans" instead of "Release Notes"
  - Moved to a new repo in GitHub.
  - Introduced the [Release Planner tool](https://exp.crm.dynamics.com/main.aspx?appid=0fe9f79a-a1f6-4064-af95-ded6c5e7bd5c&pagetype=entitylist&etn=rn_releasenote), which is where PMs put all the relevant feature information, which is then pushed into GitHub PRs and also used for the BAG product roadmap. 
- **[April '19 Release Notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/business-applications-release-notes/April19/index):** Publishing updates on Docs every week on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and in monthly PDFs until October 2019.
