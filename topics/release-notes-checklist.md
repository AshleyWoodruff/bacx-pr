Use this checklist to make all the necessary consistency changes to your Release Notes topics when you revise them or review a PR from a PM:
- If you added or removed a topic, make sure that change is updated in the TOC.
- If you want to remove or rename a topic, WAIT!!!! Follow these instructions only: [Deleting or renaming topic files](delete-rename.md)
- If a PM or you made a change, make sure it's represented in the Change history topic.
- Update the ms.date value.
- Make sure the right authors are listed for ms.author, author, and ms.reviewer.
- When the feature ships, add links to the published documentation for it in the feature description topic.
