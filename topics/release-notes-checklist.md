Use this checklist to make sure your Release Notes topics are current:
- **Metadata:**
  - Update the ms.date value.
  - Make sure the right authors are listed for ms.author, author, and ms.reviewer.
- **Change history:**
  - If a PM or you made a change, make sure it's represented in the Change history topic.
  - For features that are not scheduled, put "Undetermined" in the Target date column. 
  - For features that are both not scheduled and might ship after the current release notes timeframe, put "Undetermined*". Then add a footer that says "* This feature might not be released until after March 2019."
- When the feature ships, add links to the published documentation for it in the feature description topic.
