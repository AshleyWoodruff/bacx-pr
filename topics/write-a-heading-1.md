# SEO: Tips for writing a heading 1 (H1)

The H1 (heading 1) HTML tag is the first heading at the top of a page. The H1 has the second greatest impact on search ranking and the greatest impact on on-page relevance.  

Like the title tag in metadata, the H1 must quickly communicate the intent of the article: What a customer can learn or accomplish with the article.

One of the most complicated tasks of search engines is to understand the meaning and content of a page. In order to achieve that, the crawler uses different signals, one of which is the content in H1 tag. Using relevant keywords in the H1 helps search engines understand the intent of the page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't confuse the H1 with the title tag; they are two different text elements. The H1 displays at the top of the article and has a limit of 100 characters including spaces. The title tag is in article metadata and displays in the browser bar and on the search engine result page.

## Rules for writing H1s

- Every page must have a single H1. Don't use more than one H1 per page.

    It is OK to incorporate multiple H2 and H3 tags on a page.

- The H1 tag is at the top of the page and listed before any subheadings (H2 and H3 tags).
- Echo the language and intent from the title tag. 
    
    Because the H1 allows more characters than a title, it can be more descriptive.

- Ensure that every page has a unique H1 tag that is informative and specific to the on-page copy. 
    
    Don't use the same H1 on two or more pages.

- Include primary keyword(s) in the H1 tag to maximize intent and SEO value.
- Ensure that the H1 isn't generic; it needs to communicate a specific intent.
- Don't substitute bold or italicized text for heading tags. 

## H1 heading examples

**Example 1**: [https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/devices)

**Conversational H1**: Devices (7 characters)

**Edited H1**: Overview of device APIs for Windows desktop app technologies (60 characters)

> [!TIP]
> The current H1 tag is vague and overlaps with other Win32 pages. The updated H1 tag is much more informative and specific to the page, which ultimately helps search engines rank the content more effectively. One word is unlikely to ever be enough to describe the intent of a page. Add detail to sparse or very short H1 text.

**Example 2**: [https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/gaming/getting-started](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/gaming/getting-started)

**Current H1**: Getting started (15 characters)

**Edited H1**: Get started with game development on Windows and Xbox (53 characters)
> [!TIP]
> Like the previous example, this H1 tag is vague and generic. Any generic phrases like “get started,” “how to,” “reference,” or “tutorial” need additional information to form a fully optimized H1 tag. In this case, added details about the topic (game development on Windows and Xbox) make the H1 tag much more informative and valuable for search engines.

**Example 3**: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/snapshot-copy-managed-disk](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/snapshot-copy-managed-disk)

**Current H1**: Create a snapshot (17 characters)

**Edited H1**: Create a snapshot of a virtual hard drive in Azure (50 characters)

> [!TIP]
> Like the other examples, the current H1 is sparse and generic. The H1 should contain specific details about the page, so the edited H1 includes more detail for users and search engines to better understand the intent.

**Example 4**: [https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/system-requirements?view=sql-server-ver15](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/system-requirements?view=sql-server-ver15)

**Current H1**: System Requirements (19 characters)

**Edited H1**:  ODBC driver system requirements for SQL Server on Linux and Mac (63 characters)

> [!TIP]
> Like one-word H1s, H1s using just two words rarely communicate page intent adequately. In this case, the current heading isn't specific enough to communicate page relevance and won’t help the page rank. The edited H1 tag includes more details that are more specific to the page copy.

**Example 5**: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/migrate/azure-migration-guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/migrate/azure-migration-guide)

**Current H1**: Azure migration guide: Before you start (39 characters)

**Edited H1**: Azure migration guide: Choices to make before you start (55 characters)

> [!TIP]
> The current H1 is detailed and relevant to the page content, so the edited version contains only minor changes. Since H1 tags don’t have the same strict character limits as title tags, the language can be less clipped. Otherwise, this H1 tag is a good example of relevant, detailed, SEO-valuable content.
