# Technical videos: Get started

Add overview paragraph.

## Start the process for a video you're planning


1.	When you are planning your videos, fill out the following form: [Product demo video request form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR9b5wR1zDLRMp9sYA_S9dMJURTJYNkNWR1FLRDNCV1FGSUNENEVPUkNMVi4u)
2.	Ping Abhinav and Renee. 
3.	Abhinav and Renee will review the form and ask for script revisions, if any. 
    Once they approve the script, you can record your video.
    **Note:** If you don't have Camtasia yet, you can work on getting it while your script is reviewed.
4.	Record the video using Camtasia. 
5.	Abhinav edits the video.
6.	PM views and signs off on the video.
7.	Abhinav does production work so the video can be published to YouTube and RedTiger.
8.	Video team submits the video for publishing.
Please note when you do the original Camtasia recording, you will probably have to do it a second time after you get our feedback. You can avoid them by following the screen capture guidelines. Here are some common things that cause redos:

1.	Audio levels and quality
a.	Flubs - saying "um", repeating or interrupting yourself, background noise (dog barking, horn honk), things that are not possible to edit out
2.	Wrong screen resolution
3.	Use of non-approved demo data (fictitious content)
4.	Mouse movements that distract on screen
5.	Flow of video and use of transitional graphics/images - don't talk about the new thing while still on the old screen
 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Folks who already contribute content to our repos donâ€™t have to perform the **first
two** steps again. Also, this is just a one-time setup.

1.  [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) using your
    **\@Microsoft.com** email with 2-Factor Auth enabled.  
    If you already have a GitHub account, ensure that you change/set the primary
    email ID as your **\@Microsoft.com** email.<br/>
