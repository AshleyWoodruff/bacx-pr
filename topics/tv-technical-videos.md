# Technical videos: Get started

The process described here is for technical, how-to videos about the model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 (formerly called Customer Engagement apps) and Power Platform apps and features. These videos are for use as demos in product documentation on the [Dynamics 365 Docs site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/). To see contacts for a different area in BAG, see the note at the end of this article.

This page outlines the steps you take to script, record, and and get a video published. It's important that you familiarize yourself with the process because you're part of it, and you should know what to expect.

Your contacts are Abhinav Dhankar (abdhanka) and Renee Wesberry (renwe).

## Create a video

1.	When you are planning a video, fill out the following form: [Product demo video request form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR9b5wR1zDLRMp9sYA_S9dMJURTJYNkNWR1FLRDNCV1FGSUNENEVPUkNMVi4u)
2.	Ping Abhinav and Renee. 
3.	Abhinav and Renee will review the form with you and go over anything that's not clear. 
4. You write your script. See examples for reference: [Sample scripts](tv-sample-scripts.md)
5. Upload the script in step 6 of your [request form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR9b5wR1zDLRMp9sYA_S9dMJURTJYNkNWR1FLRDNCV1FGSUNENEVPUkNMVi4u). 
6. Abhinav and Renee will review it and may ask for script revisions. Once they approve the script, you can record your video. <br>
    **Note:** If you don't have Camtasia yet, you can work on getting it while your script is reviewed.
4.	Set up Camtasia on your computer, including screen resolution and other settings for screen cap and audio. <br>
    - Use these guidelines: [screen capture guidelines](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/ap/w-59584e83/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.sharepoint.com%2F%3Aw%3A%2Ft%2FAlchemy%2FEa8PejgWzWhCnrleOlx5SYABru5dTRwSukHKmxxBSMNwEg%3Fe%3DW6TebI&data=02%7C01%7Crenwe%40microsoft.com%7C94c11c2b93c94696b12d08d7dc8f98cd%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637220381621818780&sdata=1K1jVt3CDw7DveIE00cUfQvTubmthGuFFpaprfDB29M%3D&reserved=0)
    - Optionally, you can go to a studio on your campus to use that laptop and mic. See the Note below for locations. 
5.  Record the video and upload the file to this share: (**Abhinav**, where do they put the file(s)?)
6.	Abhinav edits the video. 
7.	You view and sign off on the video.
8.	Abhinav does production work to complete the video.
9.	Abhinav submits the video for publishing to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJGCg4rB3QSs8y_1FquelBQ) and RedTiger (**Abhinav** - need link).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You will need Camtasia to do the screen capture for your video. If you don't have a license for it, contact your organization's admin group for assistance. Our team (BACX) does not get the Camtasia licenses. 

### Avoiding redos
Please note when you do the original Camtasia recording, you will probably have to do it a second time after you get our feedback. You can avoid a lot of churn by following the [screen capture guidelines](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/ap/w-59584e83/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.sharepoint.com%2F%3Aw%3A%2Ft%2FAlchemy%2FEa8PejgWzWhCnrleOlx5SYABru5dTRwSukHKmxxBSMNwEg%3Fe%3DW6TebI&data=02%7C01%7Crenwe%40microsoft.com%7C94c11c2b93c94696b12d08d7dc8f98cd%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637220381621818780&sdata=1K1jVt3CDw7DveIE00cUfQvTubmthGuFFpaprfDB29M%3D&reserved=0). Here are some common things that cause redos:

- Audio levels and quality
- Verbal flubs and surprise background noise (saying "um", repeating or interrupting yourself, background noise (dog barking, horn honk); basically any distracting sounds we can't edit out
- Wrong screen resolution
- Use of non-approved demo data (fictitious content)
- Mouse movements that distract on screen
- Flow of video and use of transitional graphics/images - don't talk about the new thing while still on the old screen

### Studio space to use 
(Add info for studios they can use per geo for screen cap and good mic - **Abhinav**)
