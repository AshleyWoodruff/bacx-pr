# Technical videos: Get started


This wiki provides an overview of what it takes to ideate, script, record, and publish one. It's important that you familiarize yourself with the process because you're part of it, and you should know what to expect.
The process described here is for technical videos for model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 (formerly called Customer Engagement apps) and Power Platform apps and features. 
simple how-to videos used in documentation or blogs


If you want to do a video for another area under BAG, here are your contacts:

## Create a video

1.	When you are planning your videos, fill out the following form per video: [Product demo video request form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR9b5wR1zDLRMp9sYA_S9dMJURTJYNkNWR1FLRDNCV1FGSUNENEVPUkNMVi4u)
2.	Ping Abhinav and Renee. 
3.	Abhinav and Renee will review the form and ask for script revisions, if any. 
    Once they approve the script, you can record your video. <br>
    **Note:** If you don't have Camtasia yet, you can work on getting it while your script is reviewed.
4.	Set up your computer for capturing video and audio OR plan to go to one of our local studios to use their equipment. 
    a. Use these guidelines: [screen capture guidelines](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/ap/w-59584e83/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.sharepoint.com%2F%3Aw%3A%2Ft%2FAlchemy%2FEa8PejgWzWhCnrleOlx5SYABru5dTRwSukHKmxxBSMNwEg%3Fe%3DW6TebI&data=02%7C01%7Crenwe%40microsoft.com%7C94c11c2b93c94696b12d08d7dc8f98cd%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637220381621818780&sdata=1K1jVt3CDw7DveIE00cUfQvTubmthGuFFpaprfDB29M%3D&reserved=0)
5.  Record the video using Camtasia. 
6.	Abhinav edits the video.
7.	PM views and signs off on the video.
8.	Abhinav does production work so the video can be published to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJGCg4rB3QSs8y_1FquelBQ) and RedTiger (**need link**).
9.	Abhinav submits the video for publishing.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You will need Camtasia to create your video and audio. If you don't have a license for it, contact StudioOps or your organization's admin group for assistance. Our team (BACX) does not get the Camtasia licenses. 
> (Add info for studios they can use per geo for screen cap and good mic - Abhinav)

Please note when you do the original Camtasia recording, you will probably have to do it a second time after you get our feedback. You can avoid a lot of churn by following the [screen capture guidelines](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/ap/w-59584e83/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.sharepoint.com%2F%3Aw%3A%2Ft%2FAlchemy%2FEa8PejgWzWhCnrleOlx5SYABru5dTRwSukHKmxxBSMNwEg%3Fe%3DW6TebI&data=02%7C01%7Crenwe%40microsoft.com%7C94c11c2b93c94696b12d08d7dc8f98cd%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637220381621818780&sdata=1K1jVt3CDw7DveIE00cUfQvTubmthGuFFpaprfDB29M%3D&reserved=0). Here are some common things that cause redos:

- Audio levels and quality
    - Flubs - saying "um", repeating or interrupting yourself, background noise (dog barking, horn honk), distracting sounds we can't edit out
- Wrong screen resolution
- Use of non-approved demo data (fictitious content)
- Mouse movements that distract on screen
- Flow of video and use of transitional graphics/images - don't talk about the new thing while still on the old screen
