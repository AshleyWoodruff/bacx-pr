# Images

| Audience | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| All users | Any user viewing release plans regardless of role or responsibility.|

Images are placed within Markdown text to augment the feature detail. When you submit an image in the release planner app, it will get uploaded to the Main branch for that particular repo. It's important to consider these guidelines before you submit your images.  

## Purpose
Images are an important part of the release plans. They provide visual context for features and help the customer understand the benefits and functions of our products by highlighting important processes and capabilities. 

## Guidelines

- Use images with .jpeg or .png extensions. 

- Complete the alt-text.
  - Alt-text is necessary to conform to accessiblity standards.
  - It should be a detailed description of the image, including keywords, that's no more than 125 characters. (Screen readers tend to cut off at this length.)
  - It provides some SEO value to your feature.

- Use clear screenshots/images.
  - If it's blurry for you, it will be worse for the readers when it's live. 

- Ensure all the data, names, addresses, profile images, email addresses, phone numbers, and other content is CELA approved.
  - You will need to confirm this by toggling the check before you submit your image. 

- Use images with clear content if it's meant to be readable. 
 
- Highlight important details in fullscreen images. 
  - Often, it is unclear what the full screenshots are attempting to call out to the users. Use accessibility-friendly callout boxes, arrows, or highlights to point out important parts of the images.

- Don't use copyrighted images. 

- Don't submit an image unless you are have confirmed that the information it contains is allowed to be seen by the public.

- Don't take screenshots of your entire desktop if it's not pertitnent to the image. 
  - Many times, screenshots show fullscreens with browser tabs, taskbars, and desktops visible. If those are not necessary, crop down to include just the program in the image.

- Don't use GIFs as they are no longer allowed to be submitted in the release plans. GIFs do not display properly, and it impacts the images that go into the PDF.
