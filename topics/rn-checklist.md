# Checklist: Before you merge your PR

Use this checklist to make all the necessary consistency changes to your Release Notes topics when you revise them or review a PR from a PM:
- If you want to remove or rename a topic, WAIT!!!! Follow these instructions **only**: [Deleting or renaming topic files](delete-rename.md)
- If you added or removed a topic, or renamed a topic, make sure that change is updated in the TOC.
- If you change a release date, add or remove a feature, or change the details about a feature, make sure it's represented in the Change history topic.
- Update the ms.date value.
- Make sure the right authors are listed for ms.author, author, and ms.reviewer.
- When the feature ships, add the ship date in the Date column on the Summary of what's new page, and add links to the published documentation for it in the feature description topic.
