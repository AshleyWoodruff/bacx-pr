# Legal document publishing

The BACX team no longer publishes legal documents for products, services, apps, features, and so on. The legal documents are being centralized on the marketing site, rather thanon Docs. 

If you are a PM who needs a legal document published, start by filling out 
this request form: [BAG legal docs publication request](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_workitems/create/Task)

The person overseeing legal doc publishing is Dimpi Gandhi (dimpigan).
