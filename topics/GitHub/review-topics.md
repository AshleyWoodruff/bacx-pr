# Review your topic changes

Each time you commit changes to GitHub, the changed content is built to https://review.docs.microsoft.com. The build can take some time, but once it is complete, you can find a link to the review site in a few ways.

- **Build email** - the build system sends an email that includes review links, once a build is complete.
- **OPS Portal** - the build portal [site](https://ops.microsoft.com/#/) shows the status of all running builds. Navigate to the correct repo in the left panel. Then click the *builds* tab. A list of review links is shown for each build.
- **Direct link** - if you have a link to the topic you edited, you can append "?branch=" and the name of your branch at the end of the URL to see the build from your branch. Make sure you are linked to https://**review**.docs.microsoft.com.
