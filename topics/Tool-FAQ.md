#### How do I move my feature from one release plan to another?

#### How do I check to see what's changed in a feature entry?
In the entry, to go the "Related" tab. A short dropdown should appear, and select "Audit History" will will show you the history of the feature. 

#### What if I am still working on my feature and I don't want it to be released?
Make sure the toggle on the top of the feature is "No" for "Include in release plans."

#### If I update my detail, feature, or something else in the tool, when will it go live? 
The udpates will be included in the next publish which is shown on the schedule. 

#### Where do I find the schedule for the upcoming trains?

#### What do I do about the dates in the release plans if a feature is being released in different regions in a phased manner? 
For before a feature ships, use the month and year the feature is planned to ship. Example: April 2019
For once the features has shipped, use the day, month, and year. Example: April 12, 2019
If a feature is being released in different regions in a phased manner, use the date it first shipped regardless of which geo that was. For example, if a feature is released in Japan on April 11 and in North America on April 25, then use April 11, 2019 in the Date column. 

#### How do I create a view?

When you have your search perameters, hit "Results" under the exclamation point, and you will see the results of your view.
