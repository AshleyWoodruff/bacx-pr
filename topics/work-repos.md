# Work directly in our repos

Depending on the level of changes you want to make and whether you prefer working online using browser or use Git tools to work on a remote copy of the repo (clone) of your computer, select one of the following to know how to contribute:

| | |
|--|--|
|[Make quick edits to a topic](make-quick-edits.md)|Read this topic if you are just starting to contribute to docs, and have changes to make in a single topic. No tools required; do all your edits in browser.|
|[Make multiple changes](make-multiple-changes.md)|Read this topic if you want to know how to make changes in multiple files, create a file, upload an image, and so on. No tools required; do all your changes in browser.|
|[Make major or long running changes](make-major-changes.md)|Read this topic if you would like to clone our repo to your local computer, and use an editor of your choice to edit the .md files instead of editing in browser. This requires you to install some tools on your computer.|
