# Choose the best method for working in our repos

Depending on the level of changes you want to make and whether you prefer working online using browser or use Git tools to work on a remote copy of the repo (clone) of your computer, select one of the following to know how to contribute:

| | |
|--|--|
|[Make quick edits to a topic](make-quick-edits.md)|Do all your edits directly in remote branches using a browser. No additional tools required. Using the GitHub UI in a browser is best for people who are just starting to contribute to docs, and want to get up and running quickly to make a few edits.|
|[Make more extensive changes](make-multiple-changes.md)|Do all your edits directly in remote branches using a browser, including adding images and working in multiple files. No additional tools required. Using the GitHub UI to make more extensive changes works best for people who plan to create detailed topics regularly. If you plan to be a regular contributor, this is a good place to start.|
|[Make major or long-running changes](make-major-changes.md)|Do all your edits in a local clone of the repo, ensuring that your changes are merged into the correct remote branch. This method requires you to install some additional tools, and is best for people who understand the difference between working locally and remotely, and already have mastery of GitHub and markdown.
